So, one could be maintaining a blog on Facebook or blogging on Instagram.",

On February 20, 2014, there were around 172 million Tumblr[4] and 75.8 million WordPress[5] blogs in existence worldwide. According to critics and other bloggers, Blogger is the most popular blogging service used today. However, Blogger does not offer public statistics.[6][7] Technorati lists 1.3 million blogs as of February 22, 2014.[8]",

Some radio stations still broadcast via long wave, which means they use waves over 1,000 metres in length. In fact, radio waves range from one millimetre in length to 30,000 metres, aka 300 kilometres.\n\nThe unit used to measure radio frequencies, the hertz, abbreviated Hz, is of course an eponym to honour the said Hertz.
